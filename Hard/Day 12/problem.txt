Joey has given an array of non-negative integers a1,a2,...,an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 15).
He wants to transform this sequence to the graph.
In the graph, there are n vertices. Two vertices u and v are connected if and only if the binary representations of integers au and av differ in exactly one bit (i.e., au ⊕ av = 2^k for some integer k ≥ 0, where ⊕ denotes Bitwise XOR).
A terrible thing happened in a couple of days, Joey forgot his sequence a, and all that he remembers is constructed graph!
Can you help him, and find any sequence a1,a2,...,an, such that graph constructed by the same rules that Joey used will be the same as his graph?

Note: It is guaranteed that there are no multiple edges in the graph. It is guaranteed that there exists some solution for the given graph.

Input:
The first line of input contain two integers n, m(1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ m ≤ (n*(n − 1))/2): number of vertices and edges in Joey's graph.
Next m lines contain the description of edges: i-th line contain two integers ui,vi (1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n ; ui ≠ vi), describing undirected edge connecting vertices ui and vi in the graph.

Output:
Output n space-separated integers, a1,a2,...,an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 15).
Printed numbers should satisfy the constraints: edge between vertices u and v present in the graph if and only if au ⊕ av = 2^k for some integer k ≥ 0.
If there are multiple possible solutions, you can output any.
